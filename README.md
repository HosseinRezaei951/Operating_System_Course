# Operating System Course

Welcome to the Operating System Course repository. This repository contains coursework, projects, and special exercises designed to deepen your understanding of operating systems concepts using C++.

## Directory Structure

### Exersises

The `Exersises` directory contains various exercises to practice and reinforce concepts learned in the course:

- `Paralell_SigmaXi.cpp`: An exercise on parallel computing.

### Projects

The `Projects` directory contains detailed project implementations, each in its own sub-directory:

#### Multithreaded_Producer_Consumer

This project demonstrates the producer-consumer problem using multithreading in C++.

- `Multithreaded_Producer_Consumer.cpp`: The main C++ file implementing the multithreaded producer-consumer problem.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the multithreaded producer-consumer project.

#### Multithreaded_Producer_Consumer_WithScheduling

This project extends the producer-consumer problem by incorporating scheduling algorithms to manage thread execution.

- `Multithreaded_Producer_Consumer_WithScheduling.cpp`: The main C++ file implementing the producer-consumer problem with scheduling.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the producer-consumer with scheduling project.

#### Threading_Elevator_Simulation

This project simulates the operation of an elevator in a building using multithreading to handle requests and manage elevator movements.

- `Threading_Elevator_Simulation.cpp`: The main C++ file implementing the elevator simulation.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the threading elevator simulation project.
